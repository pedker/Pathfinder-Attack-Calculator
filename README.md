# Pathfinder Attack Calculator
This project was created to aid in playing Dungeons and Dragons (Pathfinder).

A character that I had built became so complicated that I realized that writing a script in Python was the easiest solution to keeping track of numbers.

# Using the script
* AttackRoller.py is the script that is meant to be run.
* scripts ending in 'Constants.py' are meant to hold constant values for specific characters. Make sure that the character being used has a script like this, and that it is imported in AttackRoller.py by the 2nd line of the script

# What I Learned
This script was experimental and simple. I used Object Oriented Programming and modularity, but I currently do not need the benefits of this script. I may pick this project back up if I need its benefits again at a later time.
